Static Objects (Greg)

Some objects are too large, heavy, or unwieldy for an adventruer to pick up and take with them. 
As such, these items are not allowed to be taken from the room. Instead, the user can interact with them.
Think of these as item an adventurer SHOULDN'T be allowed to take; i.e., levers on walls, computer consoles, 
filing cabinets, etc. As the dungeon file is read in, the item weight is consulted; items with "99999" as 
their item weight are tagged as items that canot be taken. 

You can test this out from the intial room, "Engine Control". There is a "holoplinth" in the room. Think
of it as a futuristic computer terminal, with a holographic GUI. Try to "take holoplinth"; you will see that
it cannot be taken. Instead, you are provided with a message that informs you that you can interact with it
instead.

Interactive Objects (Greg)

Items are rather boring if you can't do much with them. As such, our dungeon includes interactive objects. 
These are "special objects" that allow the user to do alot more with them than the standard construct allows. 
The "holoplinth" and "dataslate" are two such items. Each item has an "unlock" event associated with a verb 
pair. You can "activate" the holoplinth and "unlock" the dataslate. Each verb triggers the "unlock" event that
is specific to that item. The program is also smart enough to remember if each item is locked or unlocked at
save time. 

The holoplinth has a passphrase ("golgotha") this information is found on the backs of the orkglyph items.
The dataslate has a code ("3324"), which are found in the number of flashes in the servoskull item's eyes. 
These are harcoded in to the program. After each item has the correct code/passphrase entered into it, a new 
item is replaced that is functional. In the game sense, you unlocked access to the holoplinth's programs, 
or the dataslate's functions. The holoplinth allows you to scan the dungeon for the location of NPCs and to 
teleport to a desired room. "Access" the holoplinth after unlocking it and choose "BioScan". The plinth will 
actively search the dungeon for bioforms and return their locations.

In order to teleport, you must possess the powerpack in your inventory. If you do not have the pack, the plinth
will inform you you're unable to teleport. It is initially located in room "Intersection Epsilong Eng", which is
(w, w) from engine control. Once you take the powerpack, access the holoplinth and choose the teleport function. 
The holoplinth will inform you that the powerpack will be consumed during the process (it is removed from inventory).
Insert the powerpack into the plinth, by responding "Y" to the prompt. The holoplinth will return the available rooms
to teleport to. Choose a location by entering the associated numeric location.

Teleporation is inherently cantankerous, as any sci fi fan is aware. As such, it will often malfunction, 
making any teleportation journey perilous to the user. A random number is generated prior to teleportation. 
4-10 are safe, with no ill effects. The user's score is appended as the random number * 5.

0-3 are dangerous. 

0: The teleportation rips you apart and kills you. Game over. 
1: The teleportation reassembles you, but not correctly.  Lose 50% health.
2: The teleportation sequence rips the holoplinth from the room and transports it instead of the user. 
3: The teleportation does not contain enough energy (faulty coil?) and cannot transport the user's inventory. 

The dataslate DOES NOT HAVE ANY FUNCTION AT THE TIME OF THIS WRITING.

NPCs (Greg)

Our dungeon includes NPCs. In order to really draw a defining line between the NPCs and other items just laying
around, these NPCs have a bit of logic built into them. NPCs have two important attributes; the ability to move,
and their current mood. Naturally, if they are mobile, they can move. However, if they are mobile and angry, 
they will attempt to follow the user through the dungeon. The original thought for this logic attempted to 
account for cowardly users who would attempt to run from a fight. 

Each time the player moves within the dungeon, the NPCs move as well. Each NPC will scan rooms adjacent to
themselves, and the room they are currently in. If the player is within one of those rooms, and the NPC is angry
the NPC will follow the user through the dungeon. If they are not angry, they will move to a random ADJACENT room.

This is difficult to test, as the NPCs do move on their own. However, a "Squig" starts in the "Equipment Locker"
room, and a "Ork Nob" starts out in the "Decon Secundus" room. Both are angry and will follow you if you come 
close enough. You can verify their movement by unlocking the holoplinth, accessing it, and bioscanning. After your 
first scan, move out of the room and back into it. Then bioscan again. The NPCs will have changed locations. 

NPCs can also carry items.
